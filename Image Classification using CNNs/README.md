# Data-Science and Machine Learning

In this project, the famous Cats vs Dogs Image classification problem has been solved using Convolutional Neural Networks.
Tensorflow and Keras Python Libraries have been used to implement the project.

The following steps have been implemented:

1. The path, image size, and batch size were set.
2. The data was loaded using Tensorflow's Image Dataset from directory function.
3. Three different datasets were created for training, validation, and testing.
4. A Sequential Model was initialized.
5. Necessary Convolutional, Dense, and Pooling Layers were added.
6. Proper Activation and Dropout functions were included.
7. The model was compiled with metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, and Recall.
8. The model was evaluated on the test data.
9. The loss, accuracy, precision, and recall were printed.
